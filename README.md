#### Hello, I'm Roshni ✨

I am a Bioinformatics graduate student at [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/), building software & tools to accelerate innovation in genomic science. I'm passionate about reproducible research and open-source software. Currently I work on single-cell 'omics at the [Berlin Institute of Health at Charité](https://www.bihealth.org/en/) and [Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/bimsb) (MDC) in Germany.
