#### Hello, I'm Roshni ✨

I am a PhD student at the [MDC - Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/bimsb) and [Berlin Institute of Health at Charité](https://www.bihealth.org/en/) studying high-risk Neuroblastoma cases in small children. As part of CRC-1588, we aim to trace clonal evolution in tumor cells during Neuroblastoma evolution using single-cell genomics.
